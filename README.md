# HackHardware

A complete implementation of the hardware components from the **The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles** book, featuring RAM, ROM, ALU, and CPU implementations.

## Tools

The project uses the software suite supplied with the book to run the following programs:
1. **Hardware Simulator** - For testing HDL implementations
2. **CPU Emulator** - For testing computer architecture
3. **Assembler** - For converting assembly to machine code
4. **Text Comparer** - For verifying test outputs
